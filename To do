Edit
I don't think we need all the stuff we talked about yesterday to start. We just need 
1. something to vote on, not necessarily the ability to create more of them, and 
2. the ability to cast & count votes, not the ability search & select elections.

If we can cast and count votes, we can prove whether votes were counted as expected.

To do - Next: When someone clicks submit, I want to request a verifiable presentation of their VC

// To do
// 1. CRUD Elections
//     must have a "win condition"
//     must belong to a DID
//     use mongoDB to get this working, then move to fully decentralized (probably IPFS) after.
// 2. Search for Elections 
//     search by name
//     nice to have: search by Verifiable credential
// 3. Select/show Election
// 4. Cast a ballot(vote)
//     Authorize voter by requesting presentation of Verifiable credential
//     Cast vote 
// 5. Count votes
//     Let's just display the current vote count on the Election for now
// 6. Verify votes were counted according to the rules
//     ...not sure how to do this yet, but I'm imagining something like a block explorer

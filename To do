To do
1. CRUD Elections
    must have a "win condition"
    must belong to a DID
    use mongoDB to get this working, then move to fully decentralized (probably IPFS) after.
2. Search for Elections 
    search by name
    nice to have: search by Verifiable credential
3. Select/show Election
4. Cast a ballot(vote)
    Authorize voter by requesting presentation of Verifiable credential
    Cast vote 
5. Count votes
    Let's just display the current vote count on the Election for now
6. Verify votes were counted according to the rules
    ...not sure how to do this yet, but I'm imagining something like a block explorer
